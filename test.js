/**An elasticsearch client in NodeJS with deep relationship managenent, a query dsl and performance enhancement

Continue to use elasticsearch in Nodejs as you would. On top you can...
* Manage relationships and dependencies between nodes of the graph
* Access it using a query DSL which looks like english (Chrome extension to be made during HH16)
* Performance enhancement
* Multi lingual storage and retrieval, including search
* Role/rule based access management for crud operations

Test case coverage being done

/***
 *THINGS TO DO
DONE Change from storing strings of foreign keys to objects with _id and own:true (of added directly to this entity, and is not union from another place)
Support for multi depth join at storage level (denormalization)
Support for multi lingual field in field def
fix function results for lib/deep
Support for multi depth unionIn with name of field included



Test update with joined data, unionIn across deep paths
Add cache to dsl
Generate ES index mappings though config (nested for relationships)
Support for non schema type in queries
Define web.search and web.read contexts in TOML
db migration: create schema for DL
Add fields and join in search DSL (low prio)

TEST UPDATE
PASS - If no field has changed in source entity, do not flush it

TEST UPDATE - Union in
* Test copy to relationship across one level of depth, two levels of depth, then 4 levels of depth (induction principal)
* PASS - Adding a new field to an array should update copyTo relationship
* PASS - Setting a field should update copyTo relationship

TEST UPDATE - Joins
* Test joined data management across two levels of depth, then 4 levels of depth
* * Working - AddToSet, Set, unset, push, pull

TEST UPDTAE - Union in


TEST CREATE -

TEST GET

TEST SEARCH



LOng term:
Should work without language
Should also take index along with type
Versioning and locking for transactions
